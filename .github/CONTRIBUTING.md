We really appreciate it that you're helping to improve Suricata.

As you may know, we ask contributors to sign our contribution agreement.

For code, it's purpose is to keep the code ownership in one hand, which
is the non-profit, community governed OISF. This way we can protect it
in case of legal issues and such. For documentation the ownership is not
transfered, but a license is granted to OISF.

It's in our charter than the code will always be open source. Here you
find a page on how we view open source:

Please let us know if you have any questions.
